                        <div><h4>Streamlining Microsoft's employee survey methodology </h4></div>
                        <div class="project-content">
                            <p>
                                Microsoft has a strong methodological process involving internal surveys used to test products and methods. My role was to support the Hybrid workstream which focused on improving employees' experience in a new working environment. The results of this workstream frequently fed into publicly available output, like shown on the right, as well as internal reporting to the units that manage portions of the experience. <strong>Our group was gaining great data on an important topic but was constantly coming up against the same problem; utilizing it effectively. </strong> With 2000+ responses each month, the amount and variety of data meant that just processing open-ended responses and updating newsletters took up most of my time. If we were going to utilize this wealth of data effectively, we required a new approach.
                            </p>
                            <p>

                                To address the challenge of efficiently utilizing the wealth of data collected through our internal surveys, <strong>I proposed a significant overhaul of the survey methodology</strong>. One of the key changes was to make the survey modular, breaking it down into smaller sections, each of which was bite sized and focused on a specific topic. This modular approach allowed us to serve different respondents different questions, gaining the same depth of information while reducing the number of items respondents see from dozens to fewer than a dozen and saving everyone time. By doing so, we not only gained wider coverage across various aspects of the employee experience but also increased response rates, as respondents were more likely to complete this shortened survey.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Another important modification was the shift from open-ended questions to closed-ended ones, designed to be more easily actionable. While open-ended questions provide valuable insights, they can be time-consuming to analyze and can result in a loss of structured data. By providing respondents with a set of predefined options in closed-ended questions, we ensured that we captured specific, quantifiable responses. However, we also recognized the importance of not losing valuable information that may be emergent. To address this concern, we included an "Other" option in each closed-ended question, allowing respondents to provide additional context or input when necessary. <strong>This approach struck a balance between structured data collection and the flexibility to capture unexpected insights. With these changes, I not only streamlined the survey process but also improved our ability to extract actionable insights from the data.</strong>

                                During my tenure at JP Morgan Chase, I supported a series of initiatives aimed at enhancing the digital user experience and boosting digital account acquisition through owned advertisements and links. I was responsible for implementing significant changes across both public and private digital portals, with a strong focus on data-driven decision-making. <strong>Through rigorous A/B testing, we meticulously fine-tuned our strategies to ensure their success</strong>.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                One of the key achievements during this period was the successful implementation of personalized product recommendations for customers based on their existing holdings. By tailoring product offerings to individual customer profiles, we not only improved user satisfaction but also significantly increased digital account acquisition. Additionally, we revamped enrollment flows for various products to make them more user-friendly and intuitive, thereby removing barriers to entry and encouraging more customers to engage with our services.
                            </p>

                                <strong>As a result of these strategic changes, we witnessed a 7% increase in total account volume</strong>, primarily driven by an increase in deposit accounts, translating to approximately $20 million in marginal value each month. This not only demonstrated the effectiveness of our efforts but also underscored the importance of a user-centric approach in driving business growth and enhancing customer satisfaction at JP Morgan Chase.

                                During my early days at Microsoft, my primary focus was analyzing respondent data and adjusting mailers to inform stakeholders. It quickly became apparent that more time to research would allow me to uncover novel insights, which was a more valuable use of time. To address the analysis hurdle, I developed a series of scripts designed to automate various aspects of data management. These scripts streamlined the organization of respondent data, validated survey rating confidence intervals, populated mailer files and finally created a language model for handling open-ended responses. This innovation not only streamlined our data analysis but also introduced an objective tracking system, eliminating the need for extensive manual work and allowing greater consistency as we no longer relied on human ratings.

                                As part of the evolution of this system, we further automated the process, ensuring that every week, incoming responses were seamlessly processed and analyzed in real-time. This automation allowed us to track and compare trends in employee comments over time, providing invaluable insights into the evolving sentiments and needs of our workforce. By implementing this cutting-edge technology, we significantly enhanced our ability to understand employee feedback, ultimately contributing to a more responsive and employee-centric approach within Microsoft.

                                During my tenure at JPMC, I spearheaded a transformative technical project centered around the construction of a comprehensive data lake using behavioral clickstream data related to the acquisition process. My role involved delving deep into the user journey, meticulously tracing and recording all links and pages that led to customer applications. Through reverse-engineering this intricate path, I developed a highly efficient Teradata script that skillfully organized this vast dataset into a structured table.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                This data table represented a significant breakthrough, offering us the capability to filter and analyze critical fields such as product types, customer demographics, link types (distinguishing advertisements from static links), and more. For the first time, we gained the capacity to attribute acquisition volumes to specific links and pages, thereby unearthing invaluable insights into our digital acquisition strategies. Furthermore, it provided a holistic view of acquisition volumes and the revenue generated from these efforts.

Drawing from the principles discussed in the article on customer segmentation, I led the effort to create a segmentation model tailored specifically for our target audience. This model was designed to identify shared traits among prospective customers, allowing us to reach out to them with a more personalized approach.
                            </p>

                                The results of this project were remarkable. Instead of casting a wide net and contacting numerous potential customers, we strategically reached out to a smaller, but highly targeted group. By leveraging data-driven insights and utilizing segmentation techniques like Recency, Frequency, and Monetary Value (RFM), we were able to pinpoint those individuals who were most likely to respond positively to our offerings. As a result, not only did the likelihood of response increase significantly, but the revenue generated per outreach also saw a substantial boost. This shift in our approach demonstrated the power of data-driven decision-making and the effectiveness of customer segmentation in optimizing our outreach efforts.

                                In my role at JP Morgan Chase, I played a pivotal part in identifying and addressing a critical issue related to the effectiveness of the "Announcements" feature. It all began when I embarked on fundamental research to assess the feature's performance. What caught my attention was that the Announcements were consistently underperforming, falling far below the expected metrics. It became evident that a significantly lower number of users were actually seeing these announcements, even though the feature was designed to reach a broader audience, specifically those who logged in frequently. In some instances, the visibility rate was as low as 30%.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Upon digging deeper, I uncovered several key insights that shed light on the problem. First, I realized that all "Sign in interstitials," including "Announcements," were competing for priority in terms of display. Second, I discovered that the platform responsible for showcasing these interstitials wasn't under the jurisdiction of any internal team, resulting in a lack of controls and design guidelines. Third, a closer examination of other "Sign in interstitials" revealed a stark lack of design cohesion across the board. Lastly, I found that some of these interstitials were broken, repeatedly disrupting users instead of being dismissed after the initial display. User feedback in our Voice of Customer (VOC) channels confirmed that this issue was causing significant frustration.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                To tackle this issue head-on, my team within the organization took charge of the "Sign in interstitials" platform. We implemented comprehensive design guidelines, ensuring consistency and effectiveness across all interstitials. Additionally, we fixed the broken ones, ensuring that they would function correctly and no longer disrupt users excessively. This initiative not only improved the user experience but also enhanced our ability to effectively communicate important announcements to our customers.

                                For any consumer business there is a great deal of effort put into bringing in new customers and getting existing customers onboarded to new products. Oftentimes though, when the list of products is as diverse as it currently is for JP Morgan Chase's consumer bank there is a great deal of difficulty in building a common language and tracking performance in comparable ways. When I arrived at Chase there was an expectation that each product group (Checking, Savings, Credit Cards, Personal Loans, Mortgages, Auto Leases and Auto Loans) perform their own analysis, reporting and communication. In addition, because each group was working independently these groups often competed for resources to eachothers' detriment. As a result, the analysis product groups' performed was not comparable to eachother and bankwide success was not able to be the priority.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                To tackle this challenge, I took the lead in developing a cohesive data management framework designed to facilitate consistent performance evaluation across various units. At the core of this endeavor was the overhaul and standardization of transactional enrollment data, as well as behavioral clickstream data associated with the acquisition process. This undertaking involved in-depth research into the user journey, including meticulous tracking and documentation of all links and pages leading to customer applications. By tracing these paths, we constructed a comprehensive taxonomy and subsequently created a Teradata script. This script efficiently organized the vast Adobe dataset, containing billions of rows, into a structured acquisition table of thousands of rows. This achievement established a common framework for analysis, streamlining the process and enhancing our ability to assess performance consistently across diverse products.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The impact of this project had a profound effect on our understanding of our business. With the implementation of a standardized script and the establishment of a universal data repository, we gained the ability to easily compare each group's performance metrics. This newfound capability to engage in performance discussions using a common script, rather than relying on separate and delayed data sources, significantly enhanced our agility and decision-making abilities. It also provided us with a holistic "All Chase" view of our products, enabling us to prioritize products at a high level instead of locally. In essence, this organizational overhaul not only bolstered our data analytics capabilities but also facilitated more informed decision-making.

                                During my tenure at JP Morgan Chase, I took on a pivotal role in expanding our team's capabilities and capacity. Over the course of just three months, I successfully recruited and onboarded five new team members, effectively growing our team from three to eight members. This endeavor was not just about increasing headcount; it was about strategically identifying and bringing on board individuals who would not only fit seamlessly into our team culture but also excel in their roles.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                To achieve this, I developed a rigorous and objective criteria to evaluate potential candidates. This criteria encompassed both a behavioral portion of the interview process and a coding assessment. It was essential for us to assess not only technical skills but also interpersonal qualities that would contribute to a positive and productive team dynamic. The result of this meticulous selection process was a group of individuals who not only met but exceeded our expectations. Notably, each of these new hires not only successfully integrated into the organization but also demonstrated outstanding performance in their respective roles, consistently delivering valuable contributions to our team's success.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The impact of this recruitment effort was significant. Not only did we achieve our goal of expanding the team, but we did so with individuals who not only met but consistently exceeded performance expectations. This success was not merely a numbers game; it was about building a cohesive and high-performing team that could tackle complex challenges and drive the organization forward. In essence, this initiative exemplified the power of strategic recruitment and the importance of a thorough and objective selection process in building a successful team within JP Morgan Chase.

                                During my tenure at Microsoft, I had the opportunity to play a pivotal role in enhancing the capabilities of our qualitative UX research team. Recognizing the increasing importance of data skills in our field, I took the initiative to teach team members the fundamentals of scripting and coding. This endeavor aimed not only to empower team members with new technical skills but also to leverage these skills to boost productivity and the overall performance of our team.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The first step in this process involved creating a structured curriculum that catered to the specific needs of our UX research team. I ensured that the training covered the basics of scripting and coding, making it accessible and applicable to individuals with varying levels of technical experience. Through hands-on workshops and personalized coaching, team members acquired the necessary skills to manipulate and analyze data efficiently, enabling them to draw deeper insights from their research findings.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The benefits of this initiative were multifaceted. Not only did team members gain a new skill set that made them more self-reliant in data-related tasks, but it also led to a significant improvement in our team's overall productivity. With the ability to process and analyze data independently, our research projects became more streamlined and efficient. This, in turn, allowed us to provide more timely and data-driven insights to inform product development decisions. Ultimately, by equipping our qualitative UX research team with scripting and coding skills, we not only improved our individual capabilities but also contributed to a more data-savvy and impactful team within Microsoft.
