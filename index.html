        <div><strong>Streamlining Microsoft's employee survey methodology</strong></div>
        <div class="project-content">
            <p>
                In my role at Microsoft, I played a pivotal role in transforming our departmental survey methodology. I led the charge in shifting our approach from a product-centric mindset to a more experience-centric one. This change was not just about what our products were doing, but how they were impacting the overall user experience. We recognized that understanding the user journey and their interactions with our products was crucial to delivering excellence.</p>
            <p>
                One of the most significant achievements during my tenure was streamlining our survey cadence. We had various surveys scattered across different teams, which made it challenging to gather cohesive data and generate actionable insights. I took the initiative to consolidate these disparate surveys, creating a unified approach that not only saved time but also allowed us to dive deep into the data and derive meaningful outcomes. This streamlined process improved overall efficiency, enabling us to respond more effectively to user feedback and drive enhancements that truly resonated with our customers.</p>
            <p>
                In essence, my role was about catalyzing change and fostering a culture of continuous improvement within the department. We understood that it wasn't just about what we produced but how our users experienced it. By revamping our survey methodology and consolidating surveys, we laid the foundation for a more user-centric approach, ensuring that Microsoft products not only met but exceeded user expectations.

        <div class="project-content">
            <p>
                During my tenure at JP Morgan Chase, I spearheaded a series of impactful initiatives aimed at enhancing the digital user experience and boosting digital account acquisition across all our products and lines of business. I was responsible for implementing significant changes across both public and private digital portals, with a strong focus on data-driven decision-making. Through rigorous A/B testing, we meticulously fine-tuned our strategies to ensure their success.</p>
            <p>
                One of the key achievements during this period was the successful implementation of personalized product recommendations for customers based on their existing holdings. By tailoring product offerings to individual customer profiles, we not only improved user satisfaction but also significantly increased digital account acquisition. Additionally, we revamped enrollment flows for various products to make them more user-friendly and intuitive, thereby removing barriers to entry and encouraging more customers to engage with our services.</p>
            <p>
                As a result of these strategic changes, we witnessed a remarkable 7% increase in total volume, translating to approximately $20 million in marginal value each month. This not only demonstrated the effectiveness of our efforts but also underscored the importance of a user-centric approach in driving business growth and enhancing customer satisfaction at JP Morgan Chase.

        <div><strong>Research emerging technologies that affect women's safety at UPenn </strong></div>
        <div class="project-content">
            <p>
                In the context of our research on the implications of new technologies for women's safety, my role was multifaceted and instrumental in understanding and analyzing the dataset. I began by comprehending the dataset's profile, which laid the foundation for our study. Understanding the nature and composition of the data provided essential context for our subsequent analysis, ensuring a more focused exploration. </p>
            <p>
                My expertise in performing exploratory analysis was pivotal. I quantified the accessibility and spread of information related to women's safety technologies, offering valuable insights into the prevalence of this issue and how information and technologies were being disseminated and accessed. Additionally, my evaluation of usability brought a user-centered perspective to our research, ensuring we thoroughly examined the practicality and effectiveness of these technologies in real-world scenarios. </p>
            <p>
                One of the standout contributions of my role was conducting interviews for a meta-analysis focused on apps designed to prevent sexual violence against college-aged women. These qualitative interviews added a human dimension to our research, providing deeper insights into user experiences and perceptions surrounding these apps. My comprehensive approach, encompassing both quantitative and qualitative analysis, significantly enriched our research, contributing to a more holistic understanding of the implications of technology on women's safety.

          <div><strong>Creating a data pipeline to analyze Microsoft's survey data </strong></div>
        <div class="project-content">
            <p>
              During my time at Microsoft, I pioneered the development of a groundbreaking Zero Shot language model that revolutionized our approach to handling internal employee feedback. We were faced with the challenge of deciphering thousands of open-ended responses across various topics from our employees. This innovative language model enabled us to not only create meaningful and actionable insights from this data but also introduced an objective and quantitative tracking system that was previously unattainable. It effectively eliminated the need for extensive manual analysis and interpretation, saving valuable time and resources. </p>
            <p>
              As part of the evolution of this system, we further automated the process, ensuring that every week, incoming responses were seamlessly processed and analyzed in real-time. This automation allowed us to track and compare trends in employee comments over time, providing invaluable insights into the evolving sentiments and needs of our workforce. By implementing this cutting-edge technology, we significantly enhanced our ability to understand employee feedback, ultimately contributing to a more responsive and employee-centric approach within Microsoft.</p>

        <div><strong>Engineering a data lake for digital acquisitions at Chase</strong></div>
        <div class="project-content">
            <p>
              During my tenure at JPMC, I undertook a transformative project by constructing a comprehensive data lake from behavioral clickstream data related to the acquisition process. My work involved extensive research into the user journey, meticulously tracking all links and pages that led to customer applications. By meticulously reverse-engineering the path users took, I was able to develop a Teradata script that efficiently organized this wealth of data into a structured table.</p>
            <p>
              This data table was a game-changer, allowing us to filter and analyze crucial fields such as product type, customer demographics, link types (advertisements vs. static links), and more. For the first time, we gained the ability to attribute acquisition volume to specific links and pages, providing invaluable insights into our digital acquisition strategies. Furthermore, it allowed us to gain a holistic view of acquisition volumes and revenue generated from these efforts.</p>
            <p>
              The impact of this project was profound. It empowered the consumer bank to conduct data-driven tests on ad effectiveness for different products and determine which links resonated best with specific customer segments. Additionally, it enabled us to optimize user experience elements to maximize performance metrics. In essence, this initiative not only elevated our data analytics capabilities but also empowered us to make more informed decisions and fine-tune our digital acquisition strategies, ultimately contributing to the bank's overall success.</p>

        <div><strong>Developing a customer segmentation approach to drive marketing</strong></div>
          <div class="project-content">
            <p>
              During my tenure at Independence Blue Cross, my role as a data scientist involved spearheading a crucial project that had a profound impact on how we approached prospective customers for health insurance. Drawing from the principles discussed in the article on customer segmentation, I led the effort to create a segmentation model tailored specifically for our target audience. This model was designed to identify shared traits among prospective customers, allowing us to reach out to them with a more personalized approach.</p>
            <p>
              The results of this project were remarkable. Instead of casting a wide net and contacting numerous potential customers, we strategically reached out to a smaller, but highly targeted group. By leveraging data-driven insights and utilizing segmentation techniques like Recency, Frequency, and Monetary Value (RFM), we were able to pinpoint those individuals who were most likely to respond positively to our offerings. As a result, not only did the likelihood of response increase significantly, but the revenue generated per outreach also saw a substantial boost. This shift in our approach demonstrated the power of data-driven decision-making and the effectiveness of customer segmentation in optimizing our outreach efforts.</p>
            <p>
              In essence, this project underscored the importance of understanding our customers on a granular level and tailoring our marketing strategies accordingly. By applying the principles outlined in the article, we transformed our customer outreach from a broad and indiscriminate effort into a targeted and highly efficient process, ultimately achieving a significant improvement in both response rates and revenue per outreach.</p>

        <div><strong>Fixing Chase's platform-wide Announcement feature </strong></div>
        <div class="project-content">
            <p>
              In my role at JP Morgan Chase, I played a pivotal part in identifying and addressing a critical issue related to the effectiveness of the "Announcements" feature. It all began when I embarked on fundamental research to assess the feature's performance. What caught my attention was that the Announcements were consistently underperforming, falling far below the expected metrics. It became evident that a significantly lower number of users were actually seeing these announcements, even though the feature was designed to reach a broader audience, specifically those who logged in frequently. In some instances, the visibility rate was as low as 30%.</p>
            <p>
              Upon digging deeper, I uncovered several key insights that shed light on the problem. First, I realized that all "Sign in interstitials," including "Announcements," were competing for priority in terms of display. Second, I discovered that the platform responsible for showcasing these interstitials wasn't under the jurisdiction of any internal team, resulting in a lack of controls and design guidelines. Third, a closer examination of other "Sign in interstitials" revealed a stark lack of design cohesion across the board. Lastly, I found that some of these interstitials were broken, repeatedly disrupting users instead of being dismissed after the initial display. User feedback in our Voice of Customer (VOC) channels confirmed that this issue was causing significant frustration.</p>
            <p>
              To tackle this issue head-on, my team within the organization took charge of the "Sign in interstitials" platform. We implemented comprehensive design guidelines, ensuring consistency and effectiveness across all interstitials. Additionally, we fixed the broken ones, ensuring that they would function correctly and no longer disrupt users excessively. This initiative not only improved the user experience but also enhanced our ability to effectively communicate important announcements to our customers.</p>
