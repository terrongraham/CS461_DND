                                In my role at JP Morgan Chase, I played a pivotal part in identifying and addressing a critical issue related to the effectiveness of the "Announcements" feature. It all began when I embarked on fundamental research to assess the feature's performance. What caught my attention was that the Announcements were consistently underperforming, falling far below the expected metrics. It became evident that a significantly lower number of users were actually seeing these announcements, even though the feature was designed to reach a broader audience, specifically those who logged in frequently. In some instances, the visibility rate was as low as 30%.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Upon digging deeper, I uncovered several key insights that shed light on the problem. First, I realized that all "Sign in interstitials," including "Announcements," were competing for priority in terms of display. Second, I discovered that the platform responsible for showcasing these interstitials wasn't under the jurisdiction of any internal team, resulting in a lack of controls and design guidelines. Third, a closer examination of other "Sign in interstitials" revealed a stark lack of design cohesion across the board. Lastly, I found that some of these interstitials were broken, repeatedly disrupting users instead of being dismissed after the initial display. User feedback in our Voice of Customer (VOC) channels confirmed that this issue was causing significant frustration.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                To tackle this issue head-on, my team within the organization took charge of the "Sign in interstitials" platform. We implemented comprehensive design guidelines, ensuring consistency and effectiveness across all interstitials. Additionally, we fixed the broken ones, ensuring that they would function correctly and no longer disrupt users excessively. This initiative not only improved the user experience but also enhanced our ability to effectively communicate important announcements to our customers.

                                The impact of this project was profound in terms of streamlining operations and fostering collaboration across the product groups. Now equipped with a standardized script and a shared data repository, each group could readily compare their performance metrics and share insights. This newfound ability to engage in conversations about performance using a common script, instead of relying on disparate and delayed data sources, significantly improved our agility and decision-making capabilities. In essence, this organizational overhaul not only enhanced our data analytics capabilities but also facilitated more informed and collaborative decision-making, ultimately contributing to the bank's overall success.

                                During my tenure at JP Morgan Chase, I took on a pivotal role in expanding our team's capabilities and capacity. Over the course of just three months, I successfully recruited and onboarded five new team members, effectively growing our team from three to eight members. This endeavor was not just about increasing headcount; it was about strategically identifying and bringing on board individuals who would not only fit seamlessly into our team culture but also excel in their roles.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                To achieve this, I developed a rigorous and objective criteria to evaluate potential candidates. This criteria encompassed both a behavioral portion of the interview process and a coding assessment. It was essential for us to assess not only technical skills but also interpersonal qualities that would contribute to a positive and productive team dynamic. The result of this meticulous selection process was a group of individuals who not only met but exceeded our expectations. Notably, each of these new hires not only successfully integrated into the organization but also demonstrated outstanding performance in their respective roles, consistently delivering valuable contributions to our team's success.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The impact of this recruitment effort was significant. Not only did we achieve our goal of expanding the team, but we did so with individuals who not only met but consistently exceeded performance expectations. This success was not merely a numbers game; it was about building a cohesive and high-performing team that could tackle complex challenges and drive the organization forward. In essence, this initiative exemplified the power of strategic recruitment and the importance of a thorough and objective selection process in building a successful team within JP Morgan Chase.

                                During my tenure at Microsoft, I had the opportunity to play a pivotal role in enhancing the capabilities of our qualitative UX research team. Recognizing the increasing importance of data skills in our field, I took the initiative to teach team members the fundamentals of scripting and coding. This endeavor aimed not only to empower team members with new technical skills but also to leverage these skills to boost productivity and the overall performance of our team.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The first step in this process involved creating a structured curriculum that catered to the specific needs of our UX research team. I ensured that the training covered the basics of scripting and coding, making it accessible and applicable to individuals with varying levels of technical experience. Through hands-on workshops and personalized coaching, team members acquired the necessary skills to manipulate and analyze data efficiently, enabling them to draw deeper insights from their research findings.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The benefits of this initiative were multifaceted. Not only did team members gain a new skill set that made them more self-reliant in data-related tasks, but it also led to a significant improvement in our team's overall productivity. With the ability to process and analyze data independently, our research projects became more streamlined and efficient. This, in turn, allowed us to provide more timely and data-driven insights to inform product development decisions. Ultimately, by equipping our qualitative UX research team with scripting and coding skills, we not only improved our individual capabilities but also contributed to a more data-savvy and impactful team within Microsoft.
